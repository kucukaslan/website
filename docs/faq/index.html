I don&rsquo;t see any reason for it not to be.
TBH, I do: a fancy website could&rsquo;ve been more impressive for
talent hunters/recruiters also it would amaze my colleagues.
Personally I like M. Çağrı Durgut&rsquo;s website. It is fancy, displays his wit, its blog even
has dark mode. What more do people want?
Anyway.
Previously I used a Wordpress based website hosted on Digital Ocean or webhosting or
somewhere. But as it is obvious I don&rsquo;t actively maintain this website. So I don&rsquo;t need the extra features provided by
wordpress at the cost/burden of hosting a server.">

<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Previously I used a Wordpress based website hosted on Digital Ocean or <a href="https://webhosting.com.tr">webhosting</a> or
somewhere. But as it is obvious I don&rsquo;t actively maintain this website. So I don&rsquo;t need the extra features provided by
wordpress at the cost/burden of hosting a server.</p>
<p>I wanted to have my own domain, have a fancy <a href="mailto:name@surname.com.tr">name@surname.com.tr</a> e-mail, to
turn <a href="https://landchad.net/#:~:text=into%20Internet%20Landlords">into Internet Landlord</a> instead of being internet
peasant.</p>
<p>Moreover, I wanted to do this at minimal cost, at minimal effort.
This simple website is just a bunch of markdown files that are transformed to html files with Hugo. I host the content
on a GitHub Repository, updates to website are just <code>git push</code>es (or PRs) to master. A GitHub Action is triggered and
the update is deployed. Who is hosting it? Not me, thanks to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. Not so
surprisingly, I have zero concern for uptime, zero concern for DDoS attacks, zero concern for vertical or horizontal or
diagonal scaling, zero concern for billing.</p>
<p>Similarly, I added SSL to my domain with <a href="https://cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> for free. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about
renewing the certificate etc.</p>

<h3 id="why-dont-you-have-ssl-https-on-your-website">Why don&rsquo;t you have SSL (https) on your website?</h3>
<p>I do have SSL if you type <code>https://</code> before <a href="https://kucukaslan.com.tr">kucukaslan.com.tr</a>. However, it is true that I
do not force redirects to <code>https</code>.</p>
<p>I will appeal to authority &ldquo;Paul Graham&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t either (at least for a long time).
