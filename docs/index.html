<p>This is somewhat personal website of Muhammed Can Küçükaslan, see the <a href="./about">about</a> section and the <a href="/cv.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
<p>This website is WIP, like many other thing I do.
In fact, I doubt that it is possible to <em><strong>complete</strong></em> anything.
We, (I), just call it complete when we decide not to continue working on it anymore.</p>
<p>Maybe a more philosophically cool way to put it is that, there is no
way to reach the perfection, nevertheless we can get closer and closer to it by work.<br>
As it becomes harder and slower to make progress; and if we
are satisfied with how close we are to the perfection,
we can wholeheartedly call the culmination of our work <em>complete</em>.</p>
