Last things first: this is the revisionist history of a [PR fixing a few years old bug in osmium-tool](https://github.com/osmcode/osmium-tool/pull/305), an opensource tool for working with OpenStreetMap (OSM) data.

First things second: [osmium](https://github.com/osmcode/osmium-tool) is one of my favourite tools when I work with the OSM data, along with the [JOSM editor](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/). I use osmium-tool for manipulating data, JOSM editor for visualizing and examining the data -ironically never for editing.




Ana mesaj: Technically we could have debug it ourserlves but it wouldn't have been feasible to put the effort required to reliably reproduce and fix it.
