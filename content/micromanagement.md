I have the tendency to intervene other people's work even if 
I know that they have not completed their work yet. For example,
I notice a mistake or a potential mistake in their work and
I immediately tell them about it. I do not wait for them to
finish their work and then tell them about it.

Generally they're aware of the mistake and they're going to 
correct it on their own. When I Intervene, they feel like
I'm not respecting their work and do not trust them. They may
even think that I'm trying to show off my knowledge.


My clich√© justification is that in either case - whether 
they're aware of the mistake or not - my intervention 
is at worst redundant and at best helpful. 
1. If they're aware of the mistake, then my intervention
   is redundant. But it's not harmful.
2. If they're not aware of the mistake, then my intervention
    is helpful. And it's not harmful.

Even though 1st one is not harmful in a sense, it might hurt
my relationship with them....

And for the 2nd one, I might be stealing their opportunity 
to learn something new. Whic does not seem not harmful in this sense.
