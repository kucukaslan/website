This is somewhat personal website of Muhammed Can Küçükaslan

This website is WIP, like many other thing I do. 
In fact, I doubt that it is possible to ***complete*** anything.
We, (I), just call it complete when we decide not to continue working on it anymore.

Maybe a more philosophically cool way to put it is that, there is no
way to reach the perfection, nevertheless we can get closer and closer to it by work.  
As it becomes harder and slower to make progress; and if we
are satisfied with how close we are to the perfection, 
we can wholeheartedly call the culmination of our work _complete_.
