There should be a name where an ordinary action is declared to be a crime,
and it is deemed, by everyone -including the law enforcement and the legislatures, 
normal to commit that crime unless you've made them angry by
doing legal activities that they do not approve. In that case
they will happily remember that, the former action was crime,
so they're legally entitled/required to punish you for the crime
they would never even criticize any other people for doing it.


It is the deepest deepest pit of bureaucratic hell!

Many of the 'hate speech' and 'hakaret (scorn?)' laws are examples.

Also the Rules for Comprehensive Scholarship students in a University
 whose name shall not be disclosed may exemplify it.
