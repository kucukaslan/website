I'm Muhammed Can Küçükaslan. Yet another fellow _human_.

I graduated from Department of Computer Engineering (and Math as second major)
 at Bilkent University (Ankara, Turkey) in January 2024 with high honours.

My interests (tendency) of study is _engineering_ 
that is to say building reliable (software/hardware) systems that
uses resources as efficient as possible.
 
Consequently I'm interested in the subfields of Computer Science
that are aligned with this goal such as Parallel Computing, Distributed Systems...
