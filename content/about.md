I'm Muhammed Can Küçükaslan. Yet another fellow _human_.

I'm a senior CS (and Math as second major) student at Bilkent University (Ankara, Turkey)

My interests (tendency) of study is _engineering_ that is to say building reliable systems that
uses resources as efficient as possible.
 
This is aligned with the main goals of Parallel Computing, Distributed Systems,
 Backend Engineering, Big Data Engineering(?) and so on.
