TLDR:
If you are using javascript async/await with Promises you have to know these 4 functions:
1. Promise.all
2. Promise.allSettled
3. Promise.any
4. Promise.race
no excuses - except the skill issues.

Promises are way of handling async operations in a non-blocking way.  In _real_ programming languages, one would create threads or coroutines that would concurrently (potentialy in parallel as well) execute the async operations.


microservice calls instead of SQL joins or MongoDB lookups.
This has implications on performanace, api calls vs. db queries.
